# InfoPageProject
Bootcamp first individual project
Aim is to make an 'About Me' page featuring different pages (home, bio, experience, portfolio).
Success criteria is on coding rooms under Bootcamp (1/23) Week 4 D1 Workshop.

**** WEBSITE IS BEST VIEWED WITH PIXEL 5 SCREEN DIMENSIONS ****

Positives:
    First time making use of HTML/CSS outside of learning environments. I feel like I demonstrated a fair amount of knowledge.
    The header and footer are the highlights of the whole website. They were the hardest to design and took the longest, but work the best in terms of display and functionality.

Notes for next time:

    Some content displays awkwardly at certain resolutions. This may be due to not setting the best resolutions under the media queries. Find optimum resolutions to use for media queries.
    I need a better undestanding of how to use margins and paddings.
    Need to be more familiar with Git.
    Need to understand how to group element better and call upon them when nested in classes.

I would very much like to revisit this project and make it a lot better and professional after strengthening on my HTML/CSS weakpoints.
